            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Englands Triumph And JOY for the MEETING OF THE King and Parliament.</head>
            <p>LET us renew our Acclamations and Shouts, Let us dry up our Tears, and ceaſe our Lamentations: Our <hi>Halcyon</hi> Days begin again to appear; and it is now, that we have reaſon to hope, that all our Fears and Jealouſies will vaniſh, our Diſtractions and Diviſions be remedied, and an Union and good Underſtanding be ſo well eſtabliſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his People, as may heal all our Differences, put an end to all our Troubles, make us a Comfort, and a Help to our Friends and Allies, and a Dread and Terrour to their and our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, never any Nation lay and groaned under ſuch Numbers, and Variety of Sufferings, as our has done, in the later part of this Age: Our late Civil Wars, the Plague, and Dreadful Fire, during that, we had with Foreigners and, to compleat our Misfortunes, this laſt horrid and damnable Conſpiracy of the Papiſts, which, to ſatisfie the Humors and Intereſts of ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Men, deſigned no leſs than the Death of His Majeſty, and of all, at leaſt, the greateſt part of his Proteſtant Subjects, the Subverſion of the State and Government, and the utter Extirpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Reformed Religion. Theſe are all ſuch Examples, as certainly no Tradition, Record, nor Hiſtory can parallel; and which have brought us now at length, into that Condition, that we are now become almoſt as contemptible to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as we formerly were Dreadful. But it is to be hoped, that the Storm is now over, and our Sky will be clear ag<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in; the Plot is at length brought to the laſt gaſp, by his Majeſties Infinite Prudence, and indefatigable Care; and there ſeems no more wanting, than his meeting with his Parliament, to put an end to it, and all our Fears.</p>
            <p>If we may ground our Hopes upon Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we have certainly reaſon to raiſe our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations very high of the Performances of this Parliament: All its Members are well known to perſons of great Prudence and Integrity, of undaunted Courages, of indefatigable Zeal and Care, in proſecuting all ſuch as are ſuſpected of Deſigning againſt the Peace of the State, of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fidelity and Loyalty to their Prince, real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and good Patriots; ſo that there is no manner of Advantage, but what we may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to our ſelves, from the Endeavours and Zeal of ſuch Repreſentatives, under the Influence of ſo good, ſo great, and ſo glorious a King. We may now reaſonably promiſe our ſelves, that an end will be put to all Factions, all Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons removed, all Differences reconciled, our Prince enabled, and put in a poſture of protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, our Friends and Allies; and that thus this Parliament may gain the Name of the <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parliament;</hi> and we have cauſe to praiſe and bleſs God, and honour it, for retrieving us from Deſtruction, when we were juſt upon the Brink of Rui<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, for bringing us ſafe into the Port, out of a Furious Tempeſt, and making us reliſh and enjoy all the pleaſures and ſatisfaction of Peace, notwithſtanding all the Efforts of our Enemies to the contrary.</p>
            <p>This indeed is a great Undertaking and Work, and conſidering the ill Circumſtances we lie at preſent <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nder, it will doubtleſs meet with a great Oppoſition, and many Obſtacles; But what is not ſuch an Aſſembly of Men capable of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Men of ſuch Fortune, Experience and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in Affairs, ſo unanimouſly elected by their Country, as being looked upon as the beſt Pilates to Steer and Weather us out of the preſent Storm; There is no queſtion, but that this Aſſembly will overcome all Difficulties, and procure and ſettle the Peace and Tranquility of the State, bring to Condign puniſhment ſuch of the Diſturbers of its Repoſe, as are in its Bowels, and humble ſuch others, as riſe up from abroad; and that they will diſſappoint and bring to nought the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances
<pb facs="tcp:98704:2"/>and Machinations, both of the one and the other.</p>
            <p>Can any King be more glorious, than ours is at the Head of ſuch a Parliament? And can any People be more happy than we are in ſuch a King? Have we not reaſon to expect all manner of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, Profit, and Advantage from this Meeting, May we not hope, that now, all our Fears and Jealouſies will vaniſh, that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will be ſecured from all the Attempts and Deſigns of the Papiſts and other Malignants, and the Church and Government freed from all Change and Innovation, that the Promoters and Abettors of Schiſm, Sedition and Tumults, will be puniſhed according to their Merits; and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that our Land will be cleared and purged of all the Diſturbers of its Peace and Repoſe. All theſe Advantages we do, with Juſtice, promiſe our ſelves, from the Prudence, Wiſdom and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of this Parliament. Methinks I ſee eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man's Face full of Joy, all their Fears and Apprehenſions are now fled, all their Conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Agonies are now retired, Satisfaction and Joy have got the upper-hand; and by the means of this Parliament, we are likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a People as Glorious and Dreadful, as our late Troubles render'd us deſpiſed and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Trade will now again flouriſh, All our Neighbours, will now as much court our Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Friendſhip, as they have lately avoided and refuſed it: Our Prince, we hope, will now be enabled to encourage and ſuccor his Friends and daunt, and ſtrike a dread into his and their Enemies; the Government be ſecured from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Libelled by every Nonſenſical Fellow; and ſuch Expedients found out, as may unite us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ourſelves, both in Opinion and Intereſt, ſo that all that we do, may turn to the Glory of God, the Honor of the King, and the Benefit and Welfare of the whole Nation in General.</p>
            <p>Peace and Tranquility will now get into the Throne, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Name become as grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and formidable, as it has been lately neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſpiſed; and we hope, that ſuch Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes will be taken, that private Intereſt may not byaſs the publick Good; but that all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations and Reſolutions, may tend to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the whole Kingdom in General, and its Advantage, Peace and Quiet, be the Rule and Standard for all our Actions, that the Security and Advancement of the True Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be endeavoured and effected both at home and abroad; that Law may have its free Courſe, and full Career, and that the Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Subject may be kept and ſecured en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and yet no Attempts nor Breaches made in the Prince's Prerogative: But that every one may act in his own Province, and that ſuch as ſhall tranſgreſs their Bounds, either out of Ambition, Intereſt, or Vanity, thinking themſelves more capable and ſufficient than they really are, and aſpiring to have their Parts at the Helm before they are called to it, and to that end, ſow Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, ſpread abroad Apprehenſions and Fears, and by theſe means, bring the People into moſt dreadful Diſtruſts and Agonies; it is ſit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that ſuch People be curbed, and bridled by ſuch Laws and Puniſhments as may daunt and diſcourage them from the like Courſes any more, and make them at reſt, and ſatisfied with the Condition and State God has put them in. To effect all this, I muſt confeſs, is one of the higheſt points of Policy. But what is not ſuch a King at the Head of his Great Council, capable of performing and bringing to paſs, ſince the Prince, and moſt of the Members of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are known to all the World, to be of a conſummate Wiſdom, of vaſt Experience in all Affairs, and of ſo true and ardent a Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and the Church of God, that doubtleſs they cannot fail of his Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their Councils and Undertakings? May we not now hope, that all the Practices and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of our Enemies will be brought to nought, that all their Deſigns and Machinations will be diſappointed and come to nothing, and that Popery and Rebellion will be rooted out of the Land, or at leaſt, their Wings ſo clipt, that they ſhall not be capable any longer or diſturbing our Repoſe, nor endanger the Safety and Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the State? The whole Nation is full of Expectation of ſuch Performances as theſe from this Auguſt Aſſembly, that its Intereſt and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare may be promoted and procured, that every Man's Honor and Fortune may be ſecured from the Aſperſions and Attempts of Seditious and ill affected Perſons, that all the corrupted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious Members of the Commonwealth be cut off, or at leaſt, ſuch Remedy is to be applied, as may heal the Diſeaſe, and prevent its ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors from ſpreading any farther into the Body of the Nation; that ſuch Expedients be found out, as may ſatisfie the Demands and Deſires both of King and People, reconcile all our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, make up all our Breaches, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite us amongſt our ſelves, that we may be no longer in Fears and Apprehenſions of Attempts from Abroad or at Home; no longer in danger of Civil and Domeſtick Broils, nor in a State of dreading the Arms of Foreigners; that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties may be ſecured, and our Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſafe from being perverted to any manner of Idolatry, whether of Papiſts or others; and that thus we may act our Parts out here in Peace and Tranquility, and that all our Deſires and Actions n ay have no other Aim than the Glory of God, the Honor of the King, the Good of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the advancement and Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
